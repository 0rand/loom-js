Loom JavaScript library for building application-specific sidechains.

This is currently in private beta, please join our Telegram to find out more [https://t.me/loomnetwork](https://t.me/loomnetwork)

The goal of this Javascript library, is to allow web browsers sign transactions for the Loom Blockchain. While this may work with Node, it is not supported currently.

Loom Network dAppChains support many different consensus models, so we will be adding specific wire information for each consensus model into this repo as time goes on. This is all abstracted from a user's perspective.
