### Note 

This is a fork of the original Tendermint wire-js. It is not ment to be compatible. 

Loom Network supports interoperability with certain versions of Tendermint and other Consensus systems like Loom dAppChain Consensus.

It is suggested you only use this version with Loom dAppChains and use the original version if you have a pure Tendermint network.
